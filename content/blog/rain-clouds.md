### The clouds have ruined my day of fun.

#### Of things I had planned, wet wasn't one.

### They've muddied up everywhere I play.

#### Without giving me a chance or say.

![Rain Cloud](https://authortodd.b-cdn.net/images/blog/rain-min.png)

## So I fought back with a garden hose.

#### I was mad; it's the path I chose.

## I don't know if any clouds got wet.

#### But they'll remember I was upset.
