description: "Human connection is important. Sometimes we think we have to fight alone because no one knows what we are dealing with or couldn't possibly share our feelings. Through a series of poems in rhyme, this book chips away at those labels that make us feel trapped or isolated by showing the common bonds and emotions of humanity."

"Written by a policeman whose family has suffered great loss, Nursery Rhymes for Humanity is the story of life told in exquisite rhyme. Schimmell's compact collection of poems expands with each entry until it inexorably weaves its way into hearts. Be prepared to laugh and cry."
