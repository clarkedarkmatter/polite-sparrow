I've had Iguana sketched on paper for about a month. I finally got to put him in the computer for 'Carl The Chameleon'.

He's only in the story one time but I'm definitely digging his vibe. Between Carl and 'The Elephant Tooted' (2/2/22), this first half of the year is going to be pretty jam packed with giggles and wonderful life lessons!

Thanks for growing with me, my family, and our little publishing company!
