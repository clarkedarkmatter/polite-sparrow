### "Every must go!" yells Jack Monroe.
#### He'll sell anything to make some dough.
#### It doesn't matter what or to who,
#### If it's something old, borrowed, or new.
### Jack doesn't care if you want it or not.
#### He'll simply ask, "How much do you got?"

#### Nothing's off limits, it's all for sale.
#### He'll sell his house down to the last nail.
#### Jack needs all his things gone, but none know why.
### He tries to sell his thoughts to all who try.
