In my next book 'Curious Troll' I have one picture with a trout named Oscar. I knew he didn't look right and he stumped me all weekend.

I sent several variations to my wife and she would reject them all right away.

#### She kept saying that face is all wrong.

Finally I figured it out! This is why she is a great Art Director for our kids publishing company.

#### This happens quite often.

I'm so glad I have a partner who knows my abilities and will push me to get where we want to go! We make a great team, and always will!
