### Jean was on stage before the big debate.

# Tidying up, the candidates were late.

## She felt the crowd's eye as she swept the floor.

# Then people started chanting, "MORE, MORE, MORE!"

## Someone shouted, "She's showing us her plan!

## She will clean up the city, I'm her fan!"

# Jean was baffled, but she loved to entertain.

## She held up her broom, and the group went insane!

## The candidates arrived, but they were ignored.

## The crowd wanted Jean; they all cheered and ROARED!!

# What a chain of events, unforeseen and rare.

## Jean went on stage to clean but left the new mayor.
